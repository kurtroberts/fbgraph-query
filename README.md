#fbgraph-query

Mostly, I did this to explore different tools to query the Facebook Social Graph, and understand the positively Byzantine permissions scheme.

It might be useful if you just hate the Graph API Explorer, or if you want to try using different tokens, or want to get information back from the graph in the shell. But this readme is already almost as long as the code.
